üòÉ Face Emotion Detection Model ‚Äì AI-Based Emotion Recognition
Overview:
The Face Emotion Detection Model is a machine learning project designed to classify human facial expressions into emotional categories such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, etc. This project leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to analyze facial features and predict emotional states in real-time.

üß© Problem Statement:
Emotion recognition is increasingly important in fields like mental health monitoring, human-computer interaction, customer service, and surveillance. Traditional systems lack the ability to understand human emotions dynamically. This model addresses that need by enabling machines to interpret non-verbal cues through facial expressions.

üîß Key Features:
‚úÖ Real-Time Emotion Detection: Uses webcam input or image files to detect and classify emotions.

‚úÖ CNN-Based Model Architecture: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a labeled facial emotion dataset (e.g., FER-2013 or CK+).

‚úÖ Multi-Emotion Classification: Detects multiple emotion categories including happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and neutrality.

‚úÖ Image Preprocessing Pipeline: Facial detection using OpenCV, grayscale conversion, resizing, normalization for model input.

‚úÖ Live Demo: A simple user interface that displays live predictions using webcam feed.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Tools:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries/Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

Model Type: Custom CNN for emotion classification
